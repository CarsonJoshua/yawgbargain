    <h1>Hamilton Highlander: A $10 Commander Format for the People</h1>
    <p>
        Magic players, it's time for a reckoning—a dollar-based revolution! We’ve seen Wizards of the Coast ride the
        Commander wave, pocketing cash from every new "must-have" card, every “can’t-miss” set, and every “need-it-now”
        reprint. But who can even keep up? Standard keeps getting pricier, Commander is as budget-draining as ever, and
        competitive formats demand a small fortune. Enough is enough. <em>It’s time to fight back with Hamilton
            Highlander!</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Hamilton Highlander is a new breed of Commander format where your entire deck—including your Commander—must cost
        $10 or less. This isn’t just “budget Commander”; it’s accessible Commander, a format rooted in Magic’s community
        and playable by <em>everyone</em>, not just those with bottomless wallets. Imagine the possibilities and the mad
        innovation when players are empowered to build within limits rather than shackled to the latest price-hiked
        craze. This is Commander on a shoestring—a <strong>community-driven response</strong> to the commercial
        onslaught WotC has unleashed. Hamilton Highlander doesn’t just limit prices; it levels the playing field.
    </p>

    <h2>A Business Practice Wake-Up Call</h2>
    <p>
        Let’s call it like it is: Wizards of the Coast profits most when prices rise. They release a flashy new
        Commander set, slap $30 mythics in it, and watch the hype engine work its magic. It’s predictable, and it’s
        relentless. Hamilton Highlander, on the other hand, is a direct countermeasure to that business model. As soon
        as any single card spikes in price beyond what’s reasonable, it self-corrects out of Hamilton Highlander
        eligibility. No need for official ban lists, no corporate balancing act. <em>The players define the power, not
            the publisher.</em> Overpriced? Out of the format. Affordable? Welcome to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Hamilton Highlander, cards are banned not by obscure rules committees or corporate mandates but by one simple
        rule: cost. Decks rotate organically as prices rise and fall. Is some hidden gem getting too popular? It’ll
        price itself out, making room for fresh ideas, and more hidden gems. This constant rotation based on real-world
        affordability creates a format that’s as dynamic as it is democratic. Hamilton Highlander is Magic <em>for</em>
        the players, <em>by</em> the players, and, most importantly, <em>priced</em> for the players.
    </p>

    <h2>The Self-Correcting Sweetness of a $10 Deck</h2>
    <p>
        With Hamilton Highlander, there’s no waiting on bannings or hoping for reprints. Players can shake off the
        oppressive hold of Reserved List fat cats, secret lair exclusives, and expensive single cards. If a card rises
        in popularity and jumps in price, it's self-regulating—no longer available to the $10 builder. This is a
        constantly evolving format where power shifts according to affordability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gone are the days of players needing to shell out for a single Rhystic Study or Dockside Extortionist just to
        keep up. Hamilton Highlander means playing cards that may otherwise have been relegated to the bulk bin—a format
        where unappreciated commons become MVPs. And you know what that does? It breathes life into forgotten cards,
        overlooked strategies, and <strong>creative deck-building</strong>. You’ll see decks running obscure commons,
        unleashing underused synergies, and experimenting in ways that pricier formats smother.
    </p>

    <h2>Accessible Magic is Healthy Magic</h2>
    <p>
        Think about it: how many players are out there wanting to join Commander nights but can’t justify the price of
        admission? How many seasoned players get priced out when a few "essentials" creep up in cost? Hamilton
        Highlander is the ultimate cure. It’s Magic that anyone can afford, accessible to new players, students, or
        anyone feeling the financial pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
        This format isn’t just a budget constraint; it’s a call to reinstate Magic’s heart. <em>Magic</em> is meant to
        be a game for everyone. And Hamilton Highlander keeps it that way, restoring the game’s accessibility in a
        meaningful, sustainable way. Every deck you build in Hamilton Highlander is a statement: “I’m here to play
        Magic, not WotC’s corporate cash cow.”
    </p>

    <h2>The Ultimate Level Playing Field</h2>
    <p>
        Imagine walking into a game store and knowing that your $10 deck isn’t just <em>close</em> to competitive; it’s
        practically <em>guaranteed</em> to be on par with everyone else’s. No more feeling outclassed by that one player
        who dropped hundreds on all the staples, no more barrier to entry, no need for a side job to afford a hobby.
        Hamilton Highlander means anyone with a little ingenuity and a lot of heart can be a threat at the table.
    </p>

    <h2>Long Live Hamilton Highlander</h2>
    <p>
        This is a shout-out to the unappreciated, the underdog cards, and the players who make Magic’s community what it
        is. Hamilton Highlander is the people’s Commander, and its budget isn’t a restriction—it’s liberation.
