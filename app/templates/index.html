<h1>Hamilton Highlander: A $10 Commander Format for the People</h1>
<p>
    Magic players, it's time for a reckoning—a dollar-based revolution! We’ve seen Wizards of the Coast ride the
    Commander wave, pocketing cash from every new "must-have" card, every “can’t-miss” set, and every “need-it-now”
    reprint. But who can even keep up? Standard keeps getting pricier, Commander is as budget-draining as ever, and
    competitive formats demand a small fortune. Enough is enough. <em>It’s time to fight back with Hamilton
        Highlander!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Hamilton Highlander is a new breed of Commander format where your entire deck—including your Commander—must cost
    $10 or less. This isn’t just “budget Commander”; it’s accessible Commander, a format rooted in Magic’s community
    and playable by <em>everyone</em>, not just those with bottomless wallets. Imagine the possibilities and the mad
    innovation when players are empowered to build within limits rather than shackled to the latest price-hiked
    craze. This is Commander on a shoestring—a <strong>community-driven response</strong> to the commercial
    onslaught WotC has unleashed. Hamilton Highlander doesn’t just limit prices; it levels the playing field.
</p>

<h2>A Business Practice Wake-Up Call</h2>
<p>
    Let’s call it like it is: Wizards of the Coast profits most when prices rise. They release a flashy new
    Commander set, slap $30 mythics in it, and watch the hype engine work its magic. It’s predictable, and it’s
    relentless. Hamilton Highlander, on the other hand, is a direct countermeasure to that business model. As soon
    as any single card spikes in price beyond what’s reasonable, it self-corrects out of Hamilton Highlander
    eligibility. No need for official ban lists, no corporate balancing act. <em>The players define the power, not
        the publisher.</em> Overpriced? Out of the format. Affordable? Welcome to the table.
</p>
<p>
    In Hamilton Highlander, cards are banned not by obscure rules committees or corporate mandates but by one simple
    rule: cost. Decks rotate organically as prices rise and fall. Is some hidden gem getting too popular? It’ll
    price itself out, making room for fresh ideas, and more hidden gems. This constant rotation based on real-world
    affordability creates a format that’s as dynamic as it is democratic. Hamilton Highlander is Magic <em>for</em>
    the players, <em>by</em> the players, and, most importantly, <em>priced</em> for the players.
</p>

<h2>The Self-Correcting Sweetness of a $10 Deck</h2>
<p>
    With Hamilton Highlander, there’s no waiting on bannings or hoping for reprints. Players can shake off the
    oppressive hold of Reserved List fat cats, secret lair exclusives, and expensive single cards. If a card rises
    in popularity and jumps in price, it's self-regulating—no longer available to the $10 builder. This is a
    constantly evolving format where power shifts according to affordability.
</p>
<p>
    Gone are the days of players needing to shell out for a single Rhystic Study or Dockside Extortionist just to
    keep up. Hamilton Highlander means playing cards that may otherwise have been relegated to the bulk bin—a format
    where unappreciated commons become MVPs. And you know what that does? It breathes life into forgotten cards,
    overlooked strategies, and <strong>creative deck-building</strong>. You’ll see decks running obscure commons,
    unleashing underused synergies, and experimenting in ways that pricier formats smother.
</p>

<h2>Accessible Magic is Healthy Magic</h2>
<p>
    Think about it: how many players are out there wanting to join Commander nights but can’t justify the price of
    admission? How many seasoned players get priced out when a few "essentials" creep up in cost? Hamilton
    Highlander is the ultimate cure. It’s Magic that anyone can afford, accessible to new players, students, or
    anyone feeling the financial pinch.
</p>
<p>
    This format isn’t just a budget constraint; it’s a call to reinstate Magic’s heart. <em>Magic</em> is meant to
    be a game for everyone. And Hamilton Highlander keeps it that way, restoring the game’s accessibility in a
    meaningful, sustainable way. Every deck you build in Hamilton Highlander is a statement: “I’m here to play
    Magic, not WotC’s corporate cash cow.”
</p>

<h2>The Ultimate Level Playing Field</h2>
<p>
    Imagine walking into a game store and knowing that your $10 deck isn’t just <em>close</em> to competitive; it’s
    practically <em>guaranteed</em> to be on par with everyone else’s. No more feeling outclassed by that one player
    who dropped hundreds on all the staples, no more barrier to entry, no need for a side job to afford a hobby.
    Hamilton Highlander means anyone with a little ingenuity and a lot of heart can be a threat at the table.
</p>

<h2>Long Live Hamilton Highlander</h2>
<p>
    This is a shout-out to the unappreciated, the underdog cards, and the players who make Magic’s community what it
    is. Hamilton Highlander is the people’s Commander, and its budget isn’t a restriction—it’s liberation.
